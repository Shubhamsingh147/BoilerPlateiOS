# BoilerPlateiOS
A general boiler plate for SignUp SignIn and QuickBrowse items in customised list view.
This will help developers to reuse and rebuild code which are used in 73.8% of the apps.
First one is the splash screen(sleeping for 3 secs):Just change the image and use it.

The last one being the ViewController containing the TableView with CustomTableViewCell for transparent text and images only convention.

PS: Also noting that all of the above has been done in AutoLayout, so no problem of fitting thing into different screen sizes.
All of this will surely work on iPad retina and iPad Air(1/2). :)
Request issues and merges are welcomed.
